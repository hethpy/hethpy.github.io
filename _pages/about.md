I received the B.E. degree in communication engineering from Chongqing University, Chongqing, China, in 2020. I'm currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in Electronic Information School of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. My research interests include edge computing and the associated wireless transmission.
